# ArduinoPDU
A small project for Arduino that uses a relay board coupled to an MCP23016 and an ATMEGA328P to create a desktop 12V switchable power distribution unit.

I made this so I could use AMD Eyefinity with multiple graphics cards installed in my system, both of which had displays connected.

The process was Disable monitors on GPU 2, enable Eyefinity, reconnect monitors on GPU2. That way I could have a triple display Eyefinity setup, and have another 3 monitors above that worked independantly.
