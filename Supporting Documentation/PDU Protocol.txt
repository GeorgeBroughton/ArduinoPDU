PDU Beta 5.0.1 protocol instructions.

Ascertaining if the PDU is active in the COM port you are communicating using:

Example:

?<newline> // returns "BS_PDU_MK2:<starting pin number>,<ending pin number><newline>" if PDU is active.

Setting pins:

Currently, you can only set one pin at a time, though this is intended to be expanded upon in later revisions.

Syntax is as follows:

S<Pin Number>,<Value (boolean): 0 or 1)><newline>

Example:

S0,1<newline> // sets the state of pin 0 to 1 (or On), will return 1<newline> in the terminal if successful.
S1,1<newline> // sets the state of pin 1 to 1 (or On), will return 1<newline> in the terminal if successful.
S0,0<newline> // sets the state of pin 0 to 0 (or Off), will return 0<newline> in the terminal if successful.
S1,0<newline> // sets the state of pin 1 to 0 (or Off), will return 0<newline> in the terminal if successful.

Getting pin information:

Currently, you can only get one pin at a time, though this is intended to be expanded upon in later revisions.

Syntax is as follows:

G<Pin Number><newline>

Example:

G0<newline> // gets the state of pin 0, will return 0<newline> if off, or 1<newline> if on in the terminal.
G1<newline> // gets the state of pin 1, will return 0<newline> if off, or 1<newline> if on in the terminal.
